NOTES:

input2d: file that contains all necessary grid, solver, boundary condition, etc.
         data information for beginning an IBAMR simulation. Things you can change:
		-periodic / specified boundary conditions
		-time-step size
		-end-time for simulation
		-finest grid resolution	
		-viscosity/density of fluid
		-size of domain, L [-L/2,L/2]
		-vorticity tagging
		-what geometry (.vertex, .target, etc.) files are read in (line 88/89)

main.C: main function that does the time-stepping (a lot is 'blackboxed' by 
	other functions in the background). You will only need to change flags
	for updating springs, target pts., or beams, otherwise nothing.

Makefile: file that runs to compile the code to make the executable, i.e, call
	make main2d

update_target_point_positions.C: function that updates target point positions
	by specifying how/where the points move to.

update_target_point_positions.h: header file for the update_target_point_positions.C
	file. You don't need to change anything in this.
